### Hi There ðŸ‘‹.

I'm CurvingShinx4, a 15 year old developer.

Here's some of the things I'm doing:

* Main developer of [Pickle Rick](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=726948661996552202&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847), a multi purpose Discord Bot.
* Iâ€™m currently learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Look at some of my other projects:

* [Discord-Webhooks](https://github.com/CurvingSphinx4/discord-webhooks)
* [Pterodactyl Panel Discord Bot](https://github.com/CurvingSphinx4/pterodactyl-discord)
